            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">Why we started</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">Starting Alibaba Prime was a wild rideâ€”literally. It all began with a simple idea: people love bikes, but not everyone can afford a brand-new one. We saw an opportunity in the second-hand bike marketâ€”great bikes sitting unused, while others were out there looking for affordable, high-quality rides. So, we decided to bridge the gap. At first, it was just a side hustle. Weâ€™d hunt for pre-owned bikes, refurbish them, and flip them for a fair price. But as word spread, demand skyrocketed. What started in a garage quickly turned into something much bigger. We built relationships with suppliers, streamlined our refurbishing process, and even started offering custom upgrades. Now, Alibaba Prime isnâ€™t just about reselling bikesâ€”itâ€™s about making cycling accessible, sustainable, and stylish. Whether itâ€™s a city commuter, a mountain beast, or a sleek road racer, we make sure every bike finds its perfect rider. And weâ€™re just getting started! ðŸš´ðŸ’¨</p>
